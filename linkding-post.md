# Terraform AWS Infrastructure with Bastion Host Setup

**URL:** https://github.com/yourusername/Terraform-Project-02

**Tags:** #terraform #aws #infrastructure #bastion-host #vpc #ec2 #security #devops #iac #networking

**Description:**

A comprehensive Terraform project that creates a secure AWS infrastructure with a bastion host (jump server) pattern for secure access to private instances. This project demonstrates best practices for infrastructure as code and security in AWS.

## 🏗️ Key Features

### **Infrastructure Components:**
- **VPC** with public and private subnets
- **Bastion Host** - Secure jump server in public subnet
- **EC2 Instances** - Public and private instances
- **NAT Gateway** - For private subnet internet access
- **Security Groups** - Properly configured with bastion-only access
- **Route Tables** - Segregated routing for public/private subnets

### **Security Architecture:**
- ✅ **Bastion Host Pattern** - Single point of entry for private instances
- ✅ **Reduced Attack Surface** - Only bastion host exposed to internet
- ✅ **Centralized Access Control** - All access goes through bastion
- ✅ **Audit Trail** - All access can be logged and monitored
- ✅ **Proper Security Groups** - Private instances only accessible via bastion

### **Technical Highlights:**
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Complete Terraform configuration
- **SSH Jump Host** - Seamless access to private instances
- **Ubuntu 20.04** - Latest LTS AMI for all instances
- **Proper .gitignore** - Excludes sensitive files from version control
- **Comprehensive README** - Detailed documentation and troubleshooting

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and deploy
git clone <repo-url>
cd Terraform-Project-02
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Access via bastion host
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -J ubuntu@<bastion-ip> ubuntu@<private-ip>
```

## 🔒 Security Benefits

1. **Reduced Attack Surface** - Only one public entry point
2. **Centralized Access Control** - All access goes through bastion
3. **Audit Trail** - All access can be logged and monitored
4. **Easier Management** - Single point for security updates
5. **Proper Network Segmentation** - Public and private subnets properly isolated
